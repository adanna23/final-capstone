              <p>The goal is to share my love for art. Photography and Film are two of my biggest passion. With this website, You all will be able to experience this "passion" with me</p>
              <p>I have documented the faces I've seen, places I've been and cultures I've experienced. I also infused my favorite phrase from known artists in every section. Each phrase is what inspired each photo concept. I would hope one can see the relationship between the "words" and the "pictures" because I believe the sigular phrase means different from the singular photo, but when both are observed together, it ignites a whole different emotion</p>
              <p>In the light of the pandemic, my creative outlet has been limited. I hope to change this significantly and explore a whole new aspect of photography.</p>
